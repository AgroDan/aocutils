# Advent of Code Utilities

Just my list of utils that I'll modify from a git repository. May offer more descriptions later but for now this is what you get.

To use these in another module, run the following:

```terminal
$ go get github.com/AgroDan/aocutils@v0.2.2  # or whatever version
$ go mod tidy
```

Then in the imports, make sure you refer to it as such:

```go
import "github.com/AgroDan/aocutils"
```
